# Grant's Web Portfolio (v2)

## Description
This is a portfolio that showcases my past and current projects. I built it using [React](https://reactjs.org/docs), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs), JavaScript, and CSS. The webisite is responsive for phones, tablets, and desktop computers. I will be adding a backend to this portfolio in the near future.
